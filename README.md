3. Find the module you want to remove.
4. Tap the **trash icon** next to the module.
5. **Reboot** your device.

---

**Method 2: Disable Module Without Booting (If Device is Bootlooping)**

1. **Boot into Custom Recovery (e.g., TWRP)**.
2. Navigate to:
   ```
   /data/adb/modules/
   ```
3. Delete the folder of the module you want to remove.

   Example:

   ```bash

   ```

4. Optionally, delete the file:
   ```
   /data/adb/modules/module-name/update
   ```
5. **Reboot** your device.

---

**Method 3: Using Magisk‚Äôs `disable` Flag (Advanced Recovery Option)**

1. In custom recovery, **create a file** named:
   ```
   /cache/.disable_magisk
   ```
2. This **disables all modules** temporarily.
3. Boot the phone, open Magisk, and remove the faulty module.
4. Reboot normally.

### Magisk

_Use this only if you want to remove Magisk and unroot your device completely._

1. **Open the Magisk App**.
2. Tap the **Settings icon** (‚öôÔ∏è).
3. Scroll down and tap on **Uninstall Magisk**.
4. Choose **"Complete Uninstall"**.

### Reverting to Stock ROM

2. Enable USB Debugging
   - Go to settings
   - Scroll down to About Phone

```

7. Now in Odin, you should see `<ID:0/006> Added!!` in the log
8. For adding files, select the appropriate files that matches the name from the **Stock Firmware** folder
9. In `CSC`, add CSC_OMC_ODM file.

![Odin stock](./Screenshot_3.png)

10. Now just hit Start and you are good to go!

_It should only take 1-2 reboots to get to boot up the OS. If it takes more than that, consider your phone in a bootloop. Head over to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL6IoYwI8Kg) to get out of bootloop._
